# hello-world
My name is Yulin Wang, i am a PhD studnet who is studying at VUB and UGent. My research is about the interplay between motion regulation and sleep. 
 The aim of my project is to clarify how emotion regulation, e.g. experiential emotion regulation, reappraisal, can influence the follow-up sleep physiology from the point of view of body-brain network. Importantly, the neural correlates difference between cognitive emotion regulation and experiential emotion regulation will be addressed.
