 The aim of my project is to clarify how emotion regulation, e.g. experiential emotion regulation, reappraisal, can influence the follow-up sleep physiology from the point of view of body-brain network. Importantly, the neural correlates difference between cognitive emotion regulation and experiential emotion regulation will be addressed.
